== README

This app is a celebration of the possibilities ruby on rails provides.

I am also using this app to learn to get myself to a point of a master in ruby on rails.

It will be developed using the following steps:
* Iterative using feature branches.
* I will do a video demo to teach others how to do it in one hour or less.

Features
* Manage posts.
* Make comments.
* Authentication.
* Make it pretty.
* Authorizatiuon.
